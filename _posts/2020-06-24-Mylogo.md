## Microsoft Powerpoint for a logo ?

Well what can I say? It's easy!

My main job is Product Management and if there's one piece of software that I use for low fidelity mockups, that's Powerpoint. The good thing with it is that when you make 
as many presentations as I do, then you get to become very familiar with it and work very quikly. That's why I decided to use it's "shapes" tool to create a makerspac-y logo.

<table style="width:100%">
  <tr>
    <th><img src="https://github.com/tsoniotis/popit/raw/master/assets/img/logomakingof.png" alt="logo making"></th>
 </tr>
</table>

So the idea was for the logo to have the following characteristics:
- A hand tool
- An electronics item
- Indicate what
- Indicate where

For the hand tool I opted for a screwdriver (show some imagination please), for the electronics a resistor which is an obvious item and a simple shape to make, a nut, a screw and of course the words "make" and "SKG" which is the airport code for Thessaloniki. The result was this:

<table style="width:100%">
  <tr>
    <th><img src="https://github.com/tsoniotis/popit/raw/master/assets/img/mylogo.png" alt="My logo"></th>
 </tr>
</table>

Now for the critics mumbling "he cheated, I used Adobe Illustrator", based on the time I have in my hands and the experience with some photo editing tools there's one thing to say...

**You can  my logo**
