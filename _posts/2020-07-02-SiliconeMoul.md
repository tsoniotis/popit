## Creating moulds

When it comes to creating moulds there're several ways one can go about it. 

In our case <a href="https://www.notion.so/Byron-Mach-771cb40a25704056aaafd37845932169" target="_blank">Byron</a> and I decided to work with off the self silicone, which is very cheap, you can find it in any hardwre store and it allows for many different techniques. So we decided to use twodifferent methods to showcase how anyone can do it.

Byron worked on how one can handle silicone in the same way as a bread dought and in his webiste he runs you through the process. I opted for using chemicals (because mad science suits me) to work with silicone in a liquid form, the same way I would work with epoxy resin.

So in my case as you can see in the video below I used the following:
1. 100% Silicone, which I bought from a hardware store around the corner
2. Aseton, which is basically a nail polish remover and I used it as a solvent agent
3. Container for mixing them
4. A carton container for the mould
5. A candle holder as an itme to use for the mould shape
6. A small wooden stick for mixing

So the process was very fast and the mould came out nicely as you can see in the following photos but there were some key learnings here for me, as I have used silicone and aseton for construction works but never to make a mould before.

### Key takeaways:
- Use a respirator... it stinks and it's bad for you (had a massive headache afterwards)
- When stirring the silicone with the aseton do it slowly to avoid creating bubbles in your mould... it would take to much time to remove imperfections from the final product
- Opt for paper containers... they dry out the aseton and are much easier to remove, regardless of the moulding process you follow
- Use a respirator... chemicals are bad for you!

So there you have it. Cheap and useful, off the self silicone can be very plyable and used in many ways. Give it a go and let us know how it went.

Catch you on the next assignment gang!
