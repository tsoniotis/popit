## My Learning Curve

I've done several websites up to now, so I thought it would be a breeze. However my experience was based on working with CMS platforms such as Wordpress, Drupal and Joomla or on large projects whereby Github was used as CI/CD mechanism. Creating a website directly on Github though is new to me, which meant brishing up on my html. My first attempt [popalot](https://tsoniotis.github.io/popalot/) was...well...crap basically.

<table style="width:100%">
  <tr>
    <th><img src="https://github.com/tsoniotis/popit/raw/master/assets/img/prscrn.png" alt="Pop-Machina logo"></th>
 </tr>
</table>

Since I am pressed for time, I opted for this here template which you can find [here](https://github.com/TaylanTatli/Moon). So I forked it and now I am working on the content and pages using [markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/), "a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling all forms of writing on the GitHub platform" and html, using [w3schools](https://www.w3schools.com/) to refresh my memory.

Now things are picking up and I can do things faster and more efficiently. If you fancy using a template yourself you could visit [toidicode](https://github.com/toidicode/template) on github for insipration.

More updates on the next assignment! Catch you later...
